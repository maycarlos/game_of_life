# Game Of Life

Neste projeto vou fazer um Game Of Life que funciona no terminal.

## What I'll learn

- How to structure large programs.  

- How to break down projects dowm into manageable chuncks and milestones.  

- How to write automated tests so that my computer verifies that my code is corrext for me.  

## Se ficar preso em alguma etapa

Consultar o [exemplo](https://gist.github.com/robert/5100dfffe8afbb04b560dd0fff184753).  

## Milestones

1. Build a data structure to store the board state.  

2. “Pretty-print” the board to the terminal.  

3. Given a starting board state, calculate the next one.  

4. Run the game forever.  

## Extensão aos milestones principais

1. Save interesting starting positions to files and add the ability to reload them into your Life.
